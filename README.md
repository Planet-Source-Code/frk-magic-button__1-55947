### Description

This is my first submission to PSC.

Yes it is another Button ActiveX, but this one has predefined shapes (ellipse, polygon, star, pie, arrow, arrowhead, slant box...) you can also design your own shape (mask). Background can be plain, textured, gradient or transparent. Text can be rotated (even non true type font). You can add picture. But the major difference compared to the other buttons you can currently find, is that the lightning and shadows and computed in real time. Just download it and play with it. Please leave comments with bug report and new ideas. If you want to vote for this piece of code, just do it.
